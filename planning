const hat = "^";
const hole = "O";
const fieldCharacter = "░";
const pathCharacter = "*";


Initialization:

Starter field using the field they showed

this.locationY = 0
this.locationX = 0

Location Y refers to how far 'down' we have gone - corrsponds to which of the arrays we are in inside outer array
Location X refers to how far 'accross' we have gone - corresponds to which element of inner array we are in

E.g.

[
  ["*", "░", "O"],
  ["░", "O", "░"],
  ["░", "^", "░"],
]

Y=0 X= 0 is our starting *
Move is down 1 - increment Y by + 1
Y=1 X=0 corresponds to field[1][0]
Move is 1 to right - increment X by +1
Y=1 X=1 corresponds to field[1][1]

Conversely up is Y - 1 and left is X - 1

Run Game Method: 
- while loop 
    - start with playing set to true 
    - while playing:
        - print the map (print method)
        - ask the question (for which direction) (askQuestion)
        - first check is for in bounds - if set playing to false. console log ('out of bounds'). break
        - next check for is hole - if it is set playing to false. console log ('fell in hole'). break
        - next check for is hat - if it is set playing to false. console.log ('you found it!). break
        - finally is all those fail, update this.field[this.locationY][this.locationX] = pathCharacter

askQuestion Method:
 const move = prompt('Which way?').toUpperCase()
 switch (move)

 isInbounds method
    if locationY or locationX are < 0 return false
    if locationY > field.length - 1 return false
    if locationX > field[0].length - 1 return false
    else return true

Generate field Method:

- Method takes arguments of height (rows) and width (columns) and % holes. 
- First need to decide what row and column the hat is in - use a Math.Random that is within the range of the field
- I.e. if the field is 10 x 10, there are 100 cells (0-99), so hatIndex = Math.Floor(Math.random() * 101). While hatIndex = 0, roll new index (to disallow Index 0)
- Have an empty array called field
- Loop through that field and push and number of empty arrays equal to height - 1
- Create a tracker variable for the indexes we have filled - increments each time we push an element
- Do a forEach on each Array within the field array and run a loop equal to width - 1
- on each iteration:
 - if tracker === hatIndex, push(hat)
 - else if Math.random() < %holes, push(hole)
 - else push(fieldCharacter)
 - tracker += 1
